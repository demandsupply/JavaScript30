    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team)

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team.pop()

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    console.log(players, team)

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = team.slice()
    console.log("team2: ", team2)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(team)
    console.log("team3: ", team3)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    console.log("team4: ", team4)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const newPerson = person

    console.log(person, newPerson)
    newPerson.name = 'Mario'
    console.log(person, newPerson)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const newPerson2 = Object.assign({}, person)
    console.log(person, newPerson2)
    newPerson2.name = 'Luigi'
    console.log(person, newPerson2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const newPerson3 = {...person}
    console.log(person, newPerson)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
